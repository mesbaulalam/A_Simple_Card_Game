# A Simple Card Game

## Description:
Designed using Java Swing and AWT Components, using concepts of Object Oriented Programming where users can bet money and win each round by either having “special” cards or a higher remainder when dividing the sum of their cards by 10.

## Implementation: 
    Rules to determine who has better cards:
        - J, Q, K are regarded as special cards.
        - Rule 1: The one with more special cards wins.
        - Rule 2: If both have the same number of special cards, add the face values of the other card(s) and take the remainder after dividing the sum by 10. The one with a bigger remainder wins. (Note: Ace = 1).
        - Rule 3: The dealer wins if both rule 1 and rule 2 cannot distinguish the winner.
